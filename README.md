# Library Management System
## Overview
This is a Python-based Library Management System designed to help librarians manage book inventories, track loans and returns, and recommend new purchases based on library usage data. The system uses SQL to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database that stores book information, loan and reservation history, and member details.

## Features
Book Management: Add, search, and manage books within the library's collection.
Member Management: Track library members and manage their borrowing history.
Loan & Return: Check out books to members, manage due dates, and process returns.
Reservation System: Allow members to reserve books that are currently checked out.
Purchase Recommendations: Suggest new book acquisitions based on the library's budget and loan history, using data visualization to provide insightful suggestions.

## Usage
Launch the application by running menu.py. The GUI will open, providing options to check out books, return books, search for books, and get recommendations.
Navigate through the options using the buttons provided in the GUI.
